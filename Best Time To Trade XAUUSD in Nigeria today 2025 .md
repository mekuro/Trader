## 📊 What Influences XAUUSD Price in Nigeria?

To succeed in trading gold, you need to understand what drives its price. Here are the most important factors:

### 1. **US Dollar Strength**

Gold is priced in USD. When the USD strengthens, gold often falls — and vice versa.

### 2. **Interest Rates (Especially US)**

Rising interest rates make non-yielding assets like gold less attractive. Watch for Fed rate decisions.

### 3. **Inflation and Economic Uncertainty**

Gold is seen as a hedge against inflation and economic chaos. If inflation rises, gold tends to go up.

### 4. **Geopolitical Events**

Wars, pandemics, and global instability usually push investors toward safe-haven assets like gold.

### 5. **Nigerian Naira Exchange Rate**

While XAUUSD is quoted in USD, your buying power in Nigeria depends on the Naira’s strength. A weak Naira means you pay more to trade.
