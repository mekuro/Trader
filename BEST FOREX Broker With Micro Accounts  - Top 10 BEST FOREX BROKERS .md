## 🔍 What is a Micro Forex Account?

- **0.01 lot (1,000 units)** = Micro Lot  
- Lower risk per trade  
- Ideal for testing or learning  
- Commonly used by traders with accounts under $500  

> 📌 Note: Some brokers also offer **cent accounts**, which display your balance in cents (e.g. $5 = 500 cents) for more granularity.
