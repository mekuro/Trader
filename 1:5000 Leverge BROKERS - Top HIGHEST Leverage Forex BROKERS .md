## 💡 What is 1:5000 Leverage in Forex?

Leverage of **1:5000** allows you to control \$500,000 with just \$100 in your trading account.

### Example:

* Capital: \$100
* Leverage: 1:5000
* Buying Power: \$100 × 5000 = \$500,000

While this offers significant buying power, even a minor pip movement in the wrong direction can wipe out your account. Therefore, using 1:5000 leverage **requires solid risk management and precise execution**.

> ⚠️ **High leverage magnifies both profits and losses. Never use it without a clear trading strategy.**
