## 🇳🇬 Forex Regulation in Nigeria: What You Need to Know

Nigeria’s central authority for financial regulation is the **Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC Nigeria)**. However, most Nigerian forex traders use **offshore brokers regulated by Tier-1 or Tier-2 authorities** like:

* FCA (UK)

* FSA (Seychelles)

Why?
