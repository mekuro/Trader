## What is Leverage in Forex Trading?

Leverage allows traders to control a larger position with a smaller amount of capital. It is typically expressed as a ratio, such as 1:50, 1:100, or 1:500. A **1:500 leverage** means that for every $1 of your capital, you can control up to $500 in the market.

### Example:
If you deposit $100 with a 1:500 leverage, you can open trades worth up to $50,000.

This leverage magnifies both potential profits and losses, making it essential to use with caution and a solid risk management strategy.
