## 🧠 Why Low Spreads Matter in Forex Trading

A "spread" is the difference between the bid (buy) and ask (sell) price of a currency pair. The lower the spread, the less you pay to enter and exit trades.

### Example:

* Spread of 1 pip on EUR/USD = \~\$10 per standard lot
* Spread of 0.1 pip = \~\$1 per standard lot

If you’re a high-frequency trader or scalper, **even a 0.2 pip difference can save you thousands over time**.

## ✅ Key Features to Look for in a Low-Spread Broker

* **Tight spreads on major pairs** (EUR/USD, GBP/USD, etc.)
* **ECN or Raw spread accounts**
* **Fast execution** with minimal slippage
* **Reliable regulation** (e.g., ASIC, FCA, CySEC)
* **Low commission fees or zero-commission trading**
