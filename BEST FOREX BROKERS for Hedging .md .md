* Allow multiple open positions on the same pair in opposite directions
* Not apply FIFO (First In First Out) rules
* Offer fast execution and low slippage
* Provide tight spreads and low swap rates

* 💸 **Low spreads & commissions**
* ⚙️ **Execution speed and server stability**
* 📉 **Leverage options & margin conditions**
